## What is Flap?
Flap is a comedic game about a seagull that got drunk off of a sailor's bottle of rum. You must steer your drunken avian avatar home by controlling its wings individually. Watch out for obstacles, predators, and ever-changing control schemes! 
Flap is being developed by Seth Lambert for IGME-230 at Rochester Institute of Technology.

## Flap - A Comedy Flight Simulator
### High Concept
Flap is a comedy game in which the player must use constantly changing controls to fly a drunken seagull home.
Flap blends the simulation and infinite runner genres into a wacky casual experience.
*****
### Platform
Flap will be desktop only, as it relies upon keyboard input.
*****
### Story
Far out at sea a crusty old sailor left a bottle of rum on the deck of the ship. A curious seagull happened by, took a sip and, due to its small size, became incredibly intoxicated. Now the poor bird must fly home to its nest on land to sleep it off. 
Flap has a fun, goofy mood with comical action and obstacles to avoid. Players progress across three sequentially harder zones: sea, city park, and downtown.
*****
### Aesthetics
Flap uses a simple pixel-graphics style, with a chiptune soundtrack and FX to match.
*****
### Gameplay
Each of the seagull's wings is independently controlled by a key on the keyboard. The control scheme, however, is constantly changing. Every fifteen seconds the player will be shown a new control scheme and will have one second to adapt. The player must learn everything on the fly (pun intended). Turning is achieved by flapping the wings out of sync, while straight flight is achieved by flapping in unison. There will be no tutorial, simply visual feedback regarding the starting controls.
